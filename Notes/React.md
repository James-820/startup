# React

## Overview Notes
- Is part of what runs on the browser
- D.R.Y.: Don't Repeat Yourself
- Single Page Applications have higher performance, replaces sections of the screen (half a second loses a lot of sales)
- Increases device coverage as well (**do mobile first**, more users there)
- Seen as a tool rather than an all-encompassing framework, can be used on specific parts
- _Model, view, and controller???_
- JSX combines HTML with JavaScript (it's a variant of JavaScript)
- Vite is also used, IDK what it does tho
- **IMPORTANT FUNCTION WRITING** (This makes the latency lower, this executes the functions sooner, write as if it's all running at once):
```
const Hello = () => {
    return <div>Hello React</div>;
};
```
- To add properties to the components (the curly braces stuff):
```
const Hello = ({ phrase }) => {
    return (
        <div>
            <p>Hello {phrase}</p>
        </div>
    );
};

const root =
```
- Can't return more than one tag, should probably use `<div>` to wrap it
- React component writing: `<[Component Name] [attributes] />`
- State variables:
```
```
- Basic building block in React is a component (wich is a function that returns JSX) which gets injected into the tree
- Using CSS frameworks in the JSX in React can speed up styling
- Vite: can run a live local server to host JUST the frontend, _and translates JSX to JS and HTML_ for the browser, among other things

## Part 1: Routing
- Is the thing that replaces the multiple HTML pages
- Will have a "deployReact.sh" script instead of "deployFiles"
  - There will be 2 extra steps
- Good practice: `npm run test`
- **Change** `main.css` to `app.css`, and `index.html` to `login.html` (we'll have a different `index.html`)
- We'll add `app.jsx` and `app.css`
- Other modules can only grab code if it is being exported with `export` keyword
- **Important**: must use `className=""` for HTML element tags in JSX instead of `class=""`
- Watch for `body` selector in app.css, add dot to make it a className `.body`
- The React version of the DOM is called a shadowDOM, is then copied over to the normal DOM
- The program will make a React version of the root, and then render the app into that root
- `npm run dev` then `o` in Vite lets us preview the site

## Part 2: Reactivity
