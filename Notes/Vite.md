# Vite

For deeper reading, see [this site](https://vite.dev/guide/).

- For us to use this stuff:
  - JSX
  - minification
  - polyfills
  - bundling
- We need a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a toolchain
- For this, use Vite cuz it's got a lot of good features
- Running the following commands creates a new web app in the `demoVite` directory
```
npm create vite@latest demoVite -- --template react
cd demoVite
npm install
npm run dev
```
