## HTML

### Intro Notes
- Stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
- Defines the content and structure of a web page (styling and interactivity are done with CSS and JavaScript, respectively).
- Elements are contained within tags, and the tags are contained in `<>` (the closing tag has a `/` before the name)
- Elements can have attributes, with values in single or double quotes (example: `attribute="value"`)
- The default HMTL file displayed when going to a website is `index.hmtl`, so that's a great place for the main/home page of the web application

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the Live Server extension in VS Code to display an HTML file on your machine locally to preview your work

### Structure, Media, and Input
- Structure is made up of the DOM/tree data structure. Has lots of tags, elements, and parent-child relationships between elements.
- Style can be added in the tags themselves, in a "style" tag in the head part, or by referencing a CSS stylesheet in the head

### Elements Reference List
- `<html>`
- `<head>`
