## AWS
- For setting up servers, use EC2 service from AWS
- For domain names, use Route53

### EC2 Basic Instructions

### Route53 Basic Instructions

#### Leasing a Domain Name
> [!TIP]
> The TLD (Top Level Domains) are controlled by ICANN, and the `.link` and `.click` ones are usually the cheapest.

- From AWS Console, navigate to `Route53` > `Domains` > `Registered Domains`
- Click the `Register Domains` button
- Search for and select the domain you want and select it for purchase
- Fill out the contact details

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You may need to respond to an email to verify that your contact info is correct. Check the spam folder just in case, otherwise in 15 days the domain won't be yours anymore.

- Complete your order

#### Setting Up DNS Records
> [!NOTE]
> This connects your domain name to your server's public IP address (hopefully is an elastic one so you don't have to change it).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The website will still use HTTP instead of HTTPS. That's what Caddy (below) is for.

- From AWS console, navigate to `Route53` > `Hosted Zones`
- You should see the domain name you just leased (if not, could be in `Domains` > `Pending Requests`).
- Select the domain name and click `View Details` to see the deets
- Create the root domain DNS record:
  1. Click `Create Record`
  2. Enter the public IP of the server in the Value box
  3. Click `Create Records`
  4. You should see a new `A` type record should appear (in addition to the `NS` and `SOA` types).
- Create a DNS record for any and all subdomains:
  1. Click `Create Record`
  2. Enter `*` in the `Record Name` box, this acts as a wildcard for any DNS that aren't explicitly defined
  3. Enter the public IP in the `Value` box
  4. Click `Create Records`
  5. One more `A` type record will appear, this one with an `*` in it

> [!TIP]
> Give it a few minutes for the domain name to kick in. I wasn't able to hit the domain name for a bit right after creating the records.

## Caddy
> [!NOTE]
> This is for setting up HTTPS and some security measures for the web app (See the [instructions](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/webServers/https/https.md) for more details).
