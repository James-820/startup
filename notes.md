## AWS
- For setting up servers, use EC2 service from AWS
- For domain names, use Route53

### EC2 Basic Instructions

### Route53 Basic Instructions

#### Buying a Domain Name
> [!TIP]
> The TLD (Top Level Domains) are controlled by ICANN, and the `.link` and `.click` ones are usually the cheapest.

- From AWS Console, navigate to `Route53` > `Domains` > `Registered Domains`
- Click the `Register Domains` button
- Search for and select the domain you want and select it for purchase
- Fill out the contact details

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You may need to respond to an email to verify that your contact info is correct. Check the spam folder just in case, otherwise in 15 days the domain won't be yours anymore.

- Complete your order

#### Setting Up DNS Records


## Caddy
- See the [instructions](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/webServers/https/https.md) for more details
