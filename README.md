# James Day's Startup: Habit.ly

[My Notes](notes.md)

This application will allow users to track habits and motivate them to keep completing them. To do that, there will be accountability groups that users can form, "streaks" (consecutive days the habit has been completed) will be kept track of and displayed, and I possibly will add in gamifiaction to further the positive response users get from completing goals.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology

### Elevator pitch

This webapp allows users to enter custom habits that they can track. It'll keep track of consecutive days the habit has been completed, it will allow users to form accountability groups with other users to motivate them, and it will be FREE (Ad revenue could be introduced, but only banners that don't get in the way, no pop-ups)! It will be a webapp that supports people in achieveing their goals.

### Design

These drawings just show the login screen, the user's view of their habits, and the view of what an accountability group could look like.

### Key features

- Different habit types (binary, multi-part, numerical, etc.) to better track different behaviors
- Keeps track of streaks for habits
- Accountability groups to motivate you to complete your goals, and prizes set by the group owner for completing group goals
- Custom habit and goal categories (fitness, school, spiritual, etc.) to help users organize multiple habits

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Use HTML to structure the pages within the webapp
- **CSS** - Styling the application and adding animations for a good feel for the user
- **React** - Frontend code to interact with a user, represent functionality with components, and route what is displayed using JavaScript and the React web framework. Basically, make it functional.
- **Service** - Login, logout, and register user support. Third party service will be to generate a random meme or somthing funny when a goal is met.
- **DB/Login** - Stores login for users, and what habits a user is keeping track of.
- **WebSocket** - Used to update the habits when a new day starts, and also to send messages to the accountability groups.
