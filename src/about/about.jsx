                        Habit.ly was first created by James Day, then a student at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. His goal was to create a 
                        habit tracker that would leverage group accountability to support people in their quest for progress. Later, he got super, 
                        super rich, and now lives on a private island somewhere where he can make more web apps and paint Warhammer minis in peace (or at 
                        least that's what he's manifesting for himself).

                        If you have questions or need customer support, that's really too bad. We don't have any of that stuff yet. Just be patient for now.
